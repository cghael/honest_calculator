# Honest Calculator
Build a simple calculator which later on is going to motivate users to try and do the math themselves by becoming more and more honest with them.

# Example
```
Enter an equation
> 2 + 3
You are ... lazy

Do you want to store the result? (y / n):
> y
Are you sure? It is only one digit! (y / n)
> y
Don't be silly, it's just one number! Add to the memory? (y / n)
> n
Do you want to continue calculations? (y / n):
> y
Enter an equation
> 5 + M
You are ... lazy ... very, very lazy
